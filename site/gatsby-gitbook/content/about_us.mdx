## Governance

The AIID is governed by the Partnership on AI (PAI) partner organizations and stewarded by [Sean McGregor](https://seanbmcgregor.com/) as representative of the XPRIZE Foundation (a PAI partner). There is a broad base of interest in the AIID as a research and industrial tool and the development of the incident indexing will be managed in a participatory manner. Persons and organizations contributing code and incidents will be given priority and position in the governance of the project. The following positions currently exist on the project,

**Steering:** People that have contributed significant time and resources to the project and are affiliated with a PAI partner organization.

* Sean McGregor (XPRIZE Foundation)

**PAI Staff:** Staff members at the Partnership on AI developing the project.

* Jingying Yang

**Open Source Contributors:** People that have contributed more than one pull request to the code base.

* Seth Reid (AI Forum of New Zealand)

**Incident Editors:** People that resolve incident submissions to the database.

* Sean McGregor (XPRIZE Foundation)

**Incident Contributors:** People that have contributed a large numbers of incidents to the database.

* Sam Yoon (as contractor to PAI, now with Deloitte Consulting)

There is a growing community of people concerned with the collection and characterization of AI incidents, and we encourage everyone to contribute to the development of this system.
