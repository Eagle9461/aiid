We currently accept incident reports in a [quick add](/quickadd/index.html) form.

# App Notes

The submit application is currently a holdover of the original landing page from the AIID. It collects incident reports into a Google sheet for manual resolution into the database. If you are looking for a way to contribute to the software backing the AIID, improving this application is an excellent starting point because you can immediately becomes a maintainer on the improved submission app.
