metaDescription: "The following applications have been built to integrate with the AIID"
---

The AIID is built on a document database and a collection of serverless browser applications. This means the database is highly extensible, and the application layer can have an unlimited number of views into the database. The intention behind this architecture is that it becomes possible for partner organizations, and the communities they represent, to have different views into the database. You should not treat the AIID as a static data product, but instead an analytical framework from which we collectively produce the best intelligent systems while avoiding the worst outcomes they may potentially produce.
