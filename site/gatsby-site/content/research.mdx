The aviation industry in the United States is required by law to report incidents and accidents to the Federal Aviation Administration. There is no compulsory reporting requirement for intelligent systems, so the AIID is built on the incidents that have gained sufficient notoriety to be covered in either the popular or the research press. As a result, you should consider the database to be representative of "public incidents", rather than all incidents that are known to have occured throughout the artificial intelligence industry.

# Initial Collection Methodology

**Working definition of AI Incident:** _AI incidents are events or occurrences in real life that caused or had the potential to cause physical or emotional harm to people, animals or the environment._

The current database is dominated by the initial collection of incident reports, which were assembled with the following methodology by research assistant Sam Yoon,

- An initial set of links were assembled by Yampolski and Olsson.
- The links indicated key words to find related results in a series of Google searches.
- Potentially relevant links in the top three pages of Google search results were opened and read to see whether they have quality information about the event described by the sources. If relevant, they were added to the dataset.
- Other relevant looking incidents that were identified during the search process were included in the data set
- There were certain types of results that were not included because they were either hypothetical, academic and/or did not cause real harm

# Download the Index

The public index is available for export as a document database file for the partners community, [developers](/develop), and [contributors](/apps/2-submit) of many incident reports. Please [contact](/contact) us for more information.

# Citations

Please cite either the database or individual incidents within your academic works.

**Citing the Database:** Pending a paper on arXiv, we invite you to cite:  
> McGregor, Sean. “Welcome to the AIID.” Artificial Intelligence Incident Database, Partnership on AI, aiid.partnershiponai.org. 2020-08-01.

**Citing an Incident:** Every incident has its own suggested citation that credits both the submitter(s) of the incident and the editor(s) of the incident. The submitters are the people that submitted reports associated with the incident and their names are listed in the order in which their submissions were added to the AIID. Since reports can be added to an incident record through time, our suggested citation format includes the access date. Click the `#` symbol at the bottom of an incident report to see the suggested citation for the incident.
