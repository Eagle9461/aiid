The AI Incident Database is an open source project of open source projects. Anyone can submit an app that interfaces with the incident data. Go to the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PartnershipOnAI/aiid) for more details.

## App Ideas

A few seeding ideas for apps are below, feel free to add to the list in a [pull request](https://github.com/PartnershipOnAI/aiid).

* **Resolve:** Deciding whether an incident report is a new incident or matches an incident already in the database is a manual process. With an app automatically suggesting similar incident reports within the database, it becomes easier to resolve new reports to existing incidents.
* **Fairness Classifier:** Many incidents within the database exhibit complex issues in equity and fairness. A user interface that supports both a fairness-centric view and tagging capability would enable both research outcomes and more robust design of intelligent systems before they are deployed to the real world.
