We currently accept incident reports in a [quick add](/quickadd/index.html) form.

## Attribution

Submissions made to the Quick Add app are all listed as submitted by "anonymous". If you have a list of submissions you would like to see included on the [leaderboard](/summaries/leaderboard), please send an email with the submission links and the attribution to AIIDSubmissions 'at' seanbmcgregor.com.

## App Notes

The submit application is currently a holdover of the original landing page from the AIID. It collects incident reports into a Google sheet for manual resolution into the database. If you are looking for a way to contribute to the software backing the AIID. A new submission app will be rolled out within a week.
