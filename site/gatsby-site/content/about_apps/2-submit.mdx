## Add Single Incident Reports

We currently accept incident reports in a [quick add](/apps/quickadd) form, which does not credit submitters, and the [submit app](/apps/submit) which allows you to assign credit for the submission. Both types of submissions are a great help to preventing repeating history.

## Batch Adding

If you have a large batch (i.e., more than 30) of incidents to add to the database, we can facilitate their import with a [CSV format](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLguZeFziNKKtpx14TYZ5EjBuc3FCbUGmlMIdCDU6ak/edit?usp=sharing). The steps for getting many incidents batch added to the database are,

1. Copy the [example Google Sheets document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLguZeFziNKKtpx14TYZ5EjBuc3FCbUGmlMIdCDU6ak/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Columns B through J will be imported into the database and care
should be taken to maintain their format. The first column, "Incident
Number", will not be imported directly into the database but it is
used when resolving reports to existing incidents. Incident numbers
less than 10,000 are reserved for reports that should be associated
with an incident already in the DB. Values equal to or greater than 10k
are this spreadsheet's new incident counter. So if you want to import
multiple reports for a single incident, then the incident number
should be consistent across those reports.
3. Fill in the columns with the following information,
    * title is the title of the report.
    * author(s) contains comma separated values of the authors of the
    report. Some reports will not have authors, in which case place the publication name in this field.
    * submitter(s) contains comma separated values for the people or
    organizations submitting the report.
    * incident date is the date in which the incident likely happened.
    Many times a report will be written about an incident that happened
    months or years earlier. Sometimes there will be ambiguity in when the
    incident likely took place, in which case it is OK to input a best
    guess. For incidents that are ongoing or had multiple occurances, the
    incident date should be the earliest known date.
    * date published is the date the report was posted on the web. Some
    publications do not have a publication date, in which case you should use
    the Wayback machine in support of when the publication was definitely
    added by.
    * date downloaded is the date in which the content was copy/pasted
    into the text column.
    * report address is the URL for the report.
    * image address is the image preview for the report. Capturing this
    generally requires either viewing the HTML of the web page and
    capturing static asset paths, or using a web page parser like
    NewsPlease.
    * text is the text of the report copy pasted out of the website.
