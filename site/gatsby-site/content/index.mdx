# Why "AI Incidents"?

Intelligent systems are currently prone to unforeseen and often dangerous failures when they are deployed to the real world. Much like the transportation sector before it (e.g., [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/data_research/accident_incident/) and [FARS](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars)) and more recently [computer systems](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/), intelligent systems require a repository of problems experienced in the real world so that future researchers and developers may mitigate or avoid repeated bad outcomes.

# What is an Incident?

The initial set of more than 1,000 incident reports have been intentionally broad in nature. Subsequent [versions](/roadmap) of the database will layer taxonomic systems, including the capability of applying more restrictive definitions of "incident." Current examples include,

* An *autonomous car* kills a pedestrian
* A *trading algorithm* causes a market "flash crash" where billions of dollars transfer between parties
* A *chatbot* advises a mentally ill person to self-harm

The partner community can [explore the incidents collected to date](/apps/1-discover).

# Current and Future Users

The database is a [constantly evolving](/roadmap) [data product](/develop) and [collection of applications](/apps).

* **Current Users** include system architects, industrial product developers, public relations managers, and public policy researchers. These users are invited to use the [Discover](/apps/1-discover) application to proactively discover how recently deployed intelligent systems have produced unexpected outcomes in the real world. In so doing, they may avoid making similar mistakes in their development.
* **Future Users** include support for scholarship on top of the assembled AI incidents. The first step in declaring the database "research grade" is in adding a [flexible taxonomic system](/roadmap) on top of the database.

# When Should You Report an Incident?

When in doubt of whether an event qualifies as an incident, please submit it! This project is intended to converge on a shared definition of "AI Incident" through exploration of the candidate incidents submitted by the partner community.

# Submit an Incident

We currently accept incident reports in a [quick add](/apps/quickadd) form.
